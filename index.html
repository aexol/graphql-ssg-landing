<li>We handle <a href="https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/">++billions of messages per day++</a>, putting a <a href="https://segment.com/blog/exactly-once-delivery/">++premium on correctness++</a></li>

<p>At <a href="https://close.com/">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~33 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</p>
<p>Our app’s frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Enzyme and Mocha run via Puppeteer. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using BEM methodology and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC.</p>
<p>We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi Freehand wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Sketch/Abstract and code.</p>
<p>Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints. Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close">tech stack</a> consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS.

You have significant experience with REST APIs and thoroughly understand HTTP requests. You have experience participating in code reviews and providing overall code quality suggestions to help maintain the structure and quality of the codebase.
You should have great product sense and be able to think through user experience issues before diving into the code, and you exhibit a love for great UI.</p>
<p>You’re comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a small and talented team where you're supported in your efforts to grow professionally. You are able to manage your time well, communicate effectively and collaborate in a fully distributed team.

<p>At <a href="https://close.com/">Close</a>, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~33 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</p>
<p>Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close">tech stack</a> currently consists of Python Flask/Gunicorn web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing. Our data stores include MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. All of our compute runs through CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to our Kubernetes clusters. Our backend primarily serves a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.io/">public API</a> that our front-end JavaScript app consumes.</p>
<p>We ❤️open source – using dozens of open source projects with contributions to many of them, and released some of our own like <a href="https://github.com/closeio/ciso8601">ciso8601</a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://github.com/closeio/limitlion">LimitLion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/closeio/socketshark">SocketShark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger">TaskTiger</a>, and more at <a href="https://github.com/closeio">https://github.com/closeio</a></p>

                Full Stack Javascript Developer at AddJust
              </summary>
              <article class="py-4 text-gray-400">
                <section class="markdown"><h2><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking to add a full stack JavaScript developer to our engineering team.</p>
<p>You would be part of a small team that is responsible for building out our latest product, which is currently in the design phase.</p>
<p>Some of the things we value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean code - We believe the key to moving fast is to write simple, maintainable code, and that the time spent refactoring to a simpler solution pays for itself many times over.</li>
<li>Autonomy - We are a small team with minimal process, so we look for people who can take ownership of features from inception through to production deployment.</li>
<li>Code reviews - We believe code review is important for both maintaining the standard of our code and as a learning tool.</li>
<li>Working at a sustainable pace</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></h2>
<p>These are the technologies we use:</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript - For all frontend and backend code.</li>
<li>React - For our web applications (New components are written using Hooks).</li>
<li>Apollo Client - To connect our frontend react components to our graphql backend.</li>
<li>Postgraphile - To generate a secure graphql schema from our postgresql database.</li>
<li>Postgresql - For our relational database</li>
<li>Firestore - For our real time messaging</li>
<li>Jest - For unit tests on the frontend and backend.</li>
<li>Cypress.io - For integration testing.</li>
<li>Flutter - Our mobile application is written in Flutter</li>
<li>CircleCI - For our CI/CD server.</li>
<li>AWS - Hosting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally we are looking for a full stack developer that has experience with the technologies listed above.</p>
<p>However, even if you don’t match the skill set exactly, if you have experience shipping web software for a number of years, but don't have experience in all the technologies listed, we're more than happy to teach you on the job.</p>
<h2><strong>BENEFITS</strong></h2>
<p>This is a remote position. We are looking for a 40 hour per week commitment, but if you would prefer to do a 32 or 24 hour week that could be an option for the right candidate. There would need to be at least 4 hours overlap with a 9:00am - 5:00pm window in GMT.</p>
<p>It would also be an advantage if you can meet up somewhere close to Clare (Limerick, Galway etc) on a semi-regular basis (twice a month).</p>
<p>No agencies please.</p>

      <div class="markdown"><h1>GraphQL SSG</h1>
<p><a href=""><img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/graphql-ssg.svg?style=flat" alt="NPM Version"></a>
<img src="https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-ssg/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg" alt="Build"></p>
<p>Simple bundler for GraphQL based website using esmodules. What makes it unique? It uses browser for bundling (not node)</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install globally</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm i -g graphql-ssg
</code></pre>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Init a new project. This will create <code>graphql-ssg.json</code> in current directory. You don't need a <code>package.json</code> but you can add one for type completions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">graphql-ssg --init .
</code></pre>
<p>Set up config.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/&quot;,
  &quot;in&quot;: &quot;./pages&quot;,
  &quot;out&quot;: &quot;./out&quot;,
  &quot;websocketPort&quot;: 1414,
  &quot;port&quot;: 8080
}
</code></pre>
<p>So you need to provide your schema url in and out dirs for graphql-ssg</p>
<p>You can also add headers if needed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;headers&quot;: [&quot;Authorization: Bearer MyToken&quot;]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Watch</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">graphql-ssg
</code></pre>
<p>Build</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">graphql-ssg --build
</code></pre>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
<h3>File must contain export default</h3>
<p>String returned in contained in file export default is generated via SSG phase.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export default () =&gt; {
  return html`
    &lt;div&gt;Hello world&lt;/div&gt;
  `;
};
</code></pre>
<p>To have syntax coloring in html pleas install appropriate litelement extension for your IDE.</p>
<h3>Config</h3>
<p>Config file can be generated or created manually. It should contain all the following values.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://faker.graphqleditor.com/explore-projects/feature-mole/graphql&quot;,
  &quot;in&quot;: &quot;./pages&quot;,
  &quot;out&quot;: &quot;./out&quot;,
  &quot;websocketPort&quot;: 1416,
  &quot;port&quot;: 8082
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Config Injection</h4>
<p>Config file is injected and typed. It is available only inside <code>export default</code> and <code>export const head</code> function to prevent leaking of secrets.</p>
<p>Usage in JS example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const graphQLClient = Chain(ssg.config.HOST, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${ssg.config.TOKEN}`,
  },
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Environment variables</h3>
<p>Environment variables must be put side by side to <code>graphql-ssg.json</code> in <code>.env</code> file.It is available only inside <code>export default</code> and <code>export const head</code> .</p>
<p>Usage in JS example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const graphQLClient = Chain(ssg.env.HOST, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${ssg.env.TOKEN}`,
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>It is available only inside <code>export default</code> and <code>export const head</code> function to prevent leaking of secrets.</p>
<h3>Injected built in helper code syntax functions</h3>
<p>GraphQL SSG comes with generated library</p>
<h4>Chain</h4>
<p>Works like fetch to GraphQL, where you need to provide host and/or options to receive fully Autocompleted client for schema url from your config.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { Chain } from './ssg/index.js';
const graphQLClient = Chain(ssg.config.host);

const response = await graphQLClient.query({ people: true });
</code></pre>
<h4>html</h4>
<p>It doesnt transform html in any way, but gives you syntax coloring</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { html } from './ssg/index.js';
const ADiv = html`
  &lt;div&gt;Hello world&lt;/div&gt;
`;
</code></pre>
<h4>md</h4>
<p>It renders markdown using remarkable renderer so it is transformed to html.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { md } from './ssg/index.js';
const MarkdownContent = md`
# Title of my Story

blah blah blah blah blah blah

## How to read it?
`;
</code></pre>
<h4>head</h4>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { html } from './ssg/index.js';
export const head = () =&gt; html`&lt;title&gt;Hello world!&lt;/div&gt;`;
</code></pre>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<p>You can use them as normally.</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Add esbuild</li>
<li>[ ] Add TS support</li>
<li>[x] Add intelligent .d.ts autocompletion for imported es modules</li>
<li>[x] Add image supports</li>
